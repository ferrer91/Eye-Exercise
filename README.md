# Eye Exercise

## Description:
In this project the mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. The two eyes will follow the pointer througth the display with a syncronous movement. 

## How to run:
You only need to clone my repositorie, no need install any dependency extra, just open it in your browser and move the cursor througth the display.
  
## Road Map to the future:
In the future I want to make that two eyes close when is click down and open when click up the mouse.
